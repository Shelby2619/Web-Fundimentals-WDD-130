    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>This is a website to promote traffic to the resort for people wishing to take a magical vacation away from home at an all inclusive spa/resort. We want to monitor the audience that is most likely to purchase tickets and create an informational platform for people traveling to our resort for the first time.</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p> The audience I would be advertising to would be married couples, honeymooners, or singles in have the flexibility to travel whenever they would like. Peaceful colors like blues and peaches and creams will make it feel more relaxing. The Content will be whimsical and the fonts should be bold and elegant. The audience should be most likely in the middle class and up lifestyle, as the resort is on the higher end. The common access point for the website will be through the laptop/desktop. The need for a local retreat without having to leave the country. </p>
