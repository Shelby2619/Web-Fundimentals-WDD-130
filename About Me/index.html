    <p> Hi Everyone, Happy to be here with you all, and share a little bit about myself. I am from Boston MA, and I am a returning student. An interesting fact about me is that my family is Haitian and I am a first generation American. My family is also very big on video games. So much so, that we opened an internet cafe in our hometown. And we had to include the Boba shop in the back. It's what got me into seeking a degree in Computer Science. </p>
    <p> I was born in the church, since I think that's what it means when your baptized at 8. But I remember when my mom converted, and then the missionaries teaching me and my little brother. Slowly all 8 of us, that including my mom and dad where members in a matter of months. Now my father is Bishop of one of the very few Haitian wards in the states.</p>
    <p> Now, I don't know much coding, html or css is very new to me, but I am hoping with patience and determination, I will be able to get a handle on this new skillset</p>
