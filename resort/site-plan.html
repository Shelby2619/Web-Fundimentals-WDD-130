    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>This is a website to promote traffic to the resort for people wishing to take a magical vacation away from home at an all inclusive spa/resort. We want to monitor the audience that is most likely to purchase tickets and create an informational platform for people traveling to our resort for the first time.</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p> The audience I would be advertising to would be married couples, honeymooners, or singles in have the flexibility to travel whenever they would like. Peaceful colors like blues and peaches and creams will make it feel more relaxing. The Content will be whimsical and the fonts should be bold and elegant. The audience should be most likely in the middle class and up lifestyle, as the resort is on the higher end. The common access point for the website will be through the laptop/desktop. The need for a local retreat without having to leave the country. </p>

  <h2> About Us</h2> 
  <p>
    25 Years strong, our resort has had the pleasure of hosting all who've come to relax 
    and enjoy the beauty of the Maldives, Started by a small family business back 
    in 1988, Chamber Hill grew from a small bed and breakfast to now being one
   of the most sought after couples retreat in the Indian Oceans.
    Our resort started as an escape for newlyweds who wanted some peaceful time 
   after the hectic and stressful wedding planning. This was where we decided 
   that not only our members deserved peace, but they also deserved to be pampered for
    all their hard work. We know that it takes a village to accomplish all the things you
   have accomplished, and it is now time for you to get the individual rest that you long deserved.
